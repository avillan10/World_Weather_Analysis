# World_Weather_Analysis
Module 6/ WeatherPy with Python APIs

### Purpose
Project on creating an app called, PlanMyTrip.  Weather description/ weather data will be retrieved within this module challenge. This project is in the beta testing stage---beta testers will use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Also, from the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Lastly, using the Google Maps Directions API, we will have created a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
